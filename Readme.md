# Cluedo

This project is a Python-based simulation of the classic board game "Cluedo", where players deduce the details of a murder: the perpetrator, the weapon, and the location.

## Features

- **Game Board Representation**: The `board.py` module defines the game's board layout and manages room connections.
- **Character Management**: The `characters.py` module specifies the game's characters and their attributes.
- **Game Logic**: The `game_logic.py` module handles the core mechanics, including movement, suggestions, and accusations.
- **Player Interaction**: The `player.py` module manages player-specific data and actions.
- **Main Execution**: The `main.py` script initializes the game and orchestrates gameplay flow.

## Getting Started
